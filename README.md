# Reactorings README

Reactorings - a bunch of useful scaffoldings and refactorings for React in VSCode.
Something, that missed since Angular Scaffolding and JetBrains IDEs.

Open any HTML document, select prefferable component with mouse selection, right mouse click and voila!
Also, you can create empty React component, from Explorer context menu
